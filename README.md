This project involves a web-based facial recognition system. The system prompts the user to enter an employee ID and then performs facial recognition using this ID. The aim of the project is to develop a facial recognition system that can be used for applications such as access control or identity verification by recognizing specific employees.  

_For the system to be usable, .png image files should be added to the label sections that come with changing the ID assigned to the person._
